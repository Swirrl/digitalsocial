    %h1 About us

    %p Our research focuses on assessing and visualising the ever-changing landscape of Digital Social Innovation (DSI) - which is a type of social and collaborative innovation in which final users and communities collaborate through digital platforms to produce solutions for a wide range of social needs.

    %p The main areas we will focus on are:

    %ul
      %li A clear definition of Digital Social Innovation (DSI)
      %li A set of example DSI services which will grow over time
      %li An understanding of DSI practitioners and organisations that currently support them
      %li How Digital Social Innovation can be supported within the EU 

    %p Our work on understanding DSI begins with looking at the many inspiring types of digital technologies being used around the world to facilitate new types of collaboration and create social innovations, from crowdfunding and citizen apps to open sensors and social networks. Here are some of the case studies that inspire us.

    %p Alongside learning from great practice we also want to identify the key organisations involved in shaping the DSI agenda in the EU, from the fablabs movement to the open ministry in Finland.
