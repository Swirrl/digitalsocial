      Our research focuses on assessing and visualising the ever-changing landscape
      of Digital Social Innovation (DSI) - which is a type of social and collaborative
      innovation in which final users and communities collaborate through digital
      platforms to produce solutions for a wide range of social needs.

      The main areas we will focus on are:

      * A clear definition of Digital Social Innovation (DSI)
      * A set of example DSI services which will grow over time
      * An understanding of DSI practitioners and organisations that currently support them
      * How Digital Social Innovation can be supported within the EU 

      Our work on understanding DSI begins with looking at the many inspiring types
      of digital technologies being used around the world to facilitate new types of
      collaboration and create social innovations, from crowdfunding and citizen apps
      to open sensors and social networks. Here are some of the case studies that
      inspire us.

      Alongside learning from great practice we also want to identify the key
      organisations involved in shaping the DSI agenda in the EU, from the fablabs
      movement to the open ministry in Finland.
