      Please remember we are only interested in activities that are based in the EU and which cover all of the following features:

      * Focus on grass-roots or "bottom-up" communities of users
      * Use online/digital tools or methods in a disruptive way
      * Make a positive social impact
      * Create a "network effect" through collaboration online
