      ### Add Your Projects

      Your organisation has been added! You can now add in current projects and who you work with on them.

      This could cover a wide range of things, from supporting a network of developers, to carrying out original research, providing funding and support for Digital Social Innovation.

      A project could be of any size - it may be the only thing that your organisation does, or it may be one of a number of projects that you deliver with a number of partners.

      Please remember we are only interested in projects that are based in the EU and which cover all of the following features:

      * Focus on grass-roots or "bottom-up" communities of users
      * Use online/digital tools or methods in a disruptive way
      * Make a positive social impact
      * Create a "network effect" through collaboration online
