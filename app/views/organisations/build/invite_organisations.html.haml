      ### Add a partner organisation for #{@project.name}

      This step gives you an opportunity to invite another organistaion that was involved in #{@project.name}. This will start to create a network map based on your connections and will help #{@project.name} become more visible to funders and partners across the EU.

      If more than one other organisation was involved, you can add them later.
