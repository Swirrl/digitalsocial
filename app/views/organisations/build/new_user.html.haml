      This website part of an EU wide research project on what we call Digital Social Innovation (DSI). Through taking part you will build a network profile for your organisation and help generate [open data](http://data.digitalsocial.eu) for the research team and everyone interested in this exciting field.


      If your organisation does ALL of the following:

      1.  Supports or operates online services that focus on grass-roots or “bottom-up” communities of users
      2.  Uses online/digital tools or methods in a disruptive way
      3.  Makes a positive social impact
      4.  Works in the European Union
      5.  Creates a “network effect” through collaboration online i.e. the larger number of users a service has, the better it works.

      ... then we’d like you to join us by **creating an account** below, and completing the forms that follow. By creating an account, you are agreeing to our [T+Cs](/terms-and-conditions).

      If you already have an account, you can #{link_to "log in", new_user_session_path}.
