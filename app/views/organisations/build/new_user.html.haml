    %h3 Welcome to DSI

    :markdown
      This website part of an EU wide research project on Digital Social Innovation (DSI). If your organisation supports or operates online services that do **all** of the following:

      1.  Focuses on grass-roots or "bottom-up" communities of users.
      2.  Uses online/digital tools or methods in a disruptive way
      4.  Makes a positive social impact
      4.  Works in the European Union
      5.  Creates a "network effect" through collaboration online _i.e. the larger number of users a service has, the better it works._

      ... then we'd like you to join us by **creating an account** below. If you already have an account, you can #{link_to "log in", new_user_session_path}.

        %p This is your name (not your organisation's name). This is so we know how to address you in emails etc. We won't release any personally identifying data in the open data.
